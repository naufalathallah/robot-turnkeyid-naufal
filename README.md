The test cases failed due to inconsistent text usage and got stuck during the MT 5 loading process. The issues might be:

```
1. Inconsistent text usage: This problem might be caused by the test case's failure to accurately reference text.

2. Stuck during MT 5 loading: This might be caused by network issues, server response times, or the platform itself.
```
